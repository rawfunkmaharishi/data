# Data for the band

I was trying to generate this stuff inside my [Astro](https://astro.build/) rebuild of the website, but I was definitely working against the grain of the framework, so now I have this, which is the JSON data for every gig we've ever played (and every venue we've ever played at). This is the Canonical Source Of Truth, and Astro now pulls from here at build-time.

There'll be some more data soon, when I get to our record releases.
