# Data for the band

I was trying to generate this stuff inside my [Astro](https://astro.build/) rebuild of the website, but I was definitely working against the grain of the framework, so: I've built the simplest-possible static-site-generator to generate the JSON data for every gig we've ever played (and every venue we've ever played at). It's continuously-deployed to Netlify, and Astro now pulls from [json.rawfunkmaharishi.uk](https://json.rawfunkmaharishi.uk/gigs.json), which is the Canonical Source Of Truth, at build-time.

There'll be some more data soon, when I get to our record releases and so on.
